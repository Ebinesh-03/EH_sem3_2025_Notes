WannaCry Ransomware Attack â€“ Hack Timeline 
Report 
Methodology 
I selected the WannaCry ransomware (2017) as a case study. I researched the attack using 
trusted cybersecurity blogs, incident reports, and CVE databases. I then broke down the 
attack using the 6-phase kill chain: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, 
Exploitation, Installation, and Command & Control. 
Findings 
SMBv1 was the exploited protocol (vulnerability: CVE-2017-0144) 
Attackers used EternalBlue, a leaked NSA exploit 
The ransomware spread across unpatched Windows systems rapidly- Over 200,000 
machines across 150+ countries were affected 
Conclusions 
Highlighted the dangers of using outdated protocols like SMBv1. 
Showed the importance of timely patching and network hygiene. 
Demonstrated the destructive potential of self-spreading malware. 
Code/Scripts 
No live exploit was used (as per ethical standards). Simulations and port scans were 
performed using safe tools: - nmap -p 445 scanme.nmap.org - smbclient & smbmap for SMB enumeration.
